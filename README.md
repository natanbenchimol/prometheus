                Prometheus | Liquid Propulsion Lab | USC

Description:
    Prometheus is LPL's first feed-system based igniter for our rocket engines. 
    The goal of this project is to design a Control & Data Acquisition Unit that will handle running a GUI, controlling sensors and other hardware, processing & saving information, and checking for & implementing abort scenarios if necessary.
    Currently, we are using a raspberry pi as our microcontroller and coding in python.
    prometheus_gui_test.py runs the thread which handles the GUI and all of the associated functionality.
    accessories directory contains images, objects, and other accessories that are called in our system.
